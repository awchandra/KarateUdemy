It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":40,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":40,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":21,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":17,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":40,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion.

These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion.

Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":24,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":20,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion.

Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":24,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":20,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks.

These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":24,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":20,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion.

With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments.

Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":41,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge.

These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information.

Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":21,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":21,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Engaging-in-Live-Zoom-Sessions:-Interact-with-Instructors-and-Peers-Ask-Questions-in-Real-Time-1","title":"Engaging in Live Zoom Sessions: Interact with Instructors and Peers, Ask Questions in Real-Time","description":"In our increasingly online world, personal engagement remains a crucial element of effective learning.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.

At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information.

The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges.

Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated.

Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":44,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":45,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval.

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":45,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":21,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}}],"articlesCount":15}

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":45,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Embracing-Daily-Git-Routines:-Real-Code-Reviews-on-GitHub-for-Effective-Coding-Practice.-1","title":"Embracing Daily Git Routines: Real Code Reviews on GitHub for Effective Coding Practice.","description":"Learning to code is just one part of a larger skill set; effectively managing and organizing code is equally crucial. At Bondar Academy, we integrate Git and platforms like GitHub into the core learning cycle. With us, using Git becomes a regular routine, where organizing code in branches, storing it in remote repositories, and collaborating with others through strategies like branching, merging, pull requests, and code reviews are standard practice.","body":"At Bondar Academy, mastering Git and GitHub is a fundamental step before delving into frameworks or programming languages. Effective code management, organization, and storage are crucial skills, and Git is the premier tool for this purpose. However, many learners initially find Git challenging due to its complexity and non-intuitive nature. To address this, our instructors have developed structured lectures on Git and GitHub, ensuring an efficient and thorough understanding of these essential tools. Git lessons are a mandatory prerequisite in every class. For a glimpse into our teaching approach, visit our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BondarAcademy/playlists.\n\nIn our courses, all homework assignments are reviewed using GitHub pull requests, mirroring the workflow in real-world software development environments. Students submit their code to their working branch for review. Our instructors then provide feedback, suggesting modifications or adjustments for pull request approval. This iterative process is repeated throughout the course, establishing Git usage as a natural and routine part of your coding practice.","tagList":["YouTube","Git","GitHub"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:42:31.491Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":21,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}}],"articlesCount":15}

Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them. Just ask in Slack and you'll be guided and assisted.","tagList":["Homework","Assignments","Practice","Coding"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:46:09.512Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":26,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}}],"articlesCount":16}

It answers critical questions: Have you grasped everything correctly? Is there anything you've missed? Are you prepared for the next lesson? These assessments ensure that you build a solid foundation of knowledge, confidently and efficiently paving the way for swift progress and effective learning outcomes.","body":"Traditional educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, commonly use tests and assessments to measure knowledge. This approach is effective for gauging student performance, but it's not without drawbacks. In these settings, assessments after every lecture aren't feasible due to the time required for teachers to evaluate them. This often leads to students having a false sense of understanding, believing they've comprehended all aspects of a lecture when, in reality, small but crucial details might be missed. These 'knowledge gaps' can accumulate, making more complex topics difficult to grasp later on.\n\nAt Bondar Academy, we address this challenge by implementing self-assessments after every lecture. These are designed to cover key questions that ensure a thorough understanding of the material, essential for comfort and success in future lectures. The number of questions varies, ranging from 3-4 to 15-20, depending on the lecture's significance and the volume of critical information. With these self-assessments, students receive immediate feedback, helping them determine if they've fully understood the lecture or if they need to revisit certain parts or seek assistance from our instructors in the Slack Workspace.","tagList":["Self-Assessment","Test","Exam"],"createdAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-27T21:48:36.340Z","favorited":false,"favoritesCount":45,"author":{"username":"Artem Bondar","bio":null,"image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/bondar-academy-visuals/Android.png","following":false}},{"slug":"Practical-Implementation-of-Skills:-Homework-Assignments-with-Instructor-Supervision-1","title":"Practical Implementation of Skills: Homework Assignments with Instructor Supervision","description":"Knowledge or skills not reinforced through practical exercises can quickly fade, often faster than anticipated. Homework, particularly in tasks like writing your own code, is crucial for honing these skills and cementing your understanding. At Bondar Academy, we ensure this vital step by assigning homework, rigorously evaluating the outcomes, and providing valuable feedback to guide your learning journey.","body":"Homework assignments are a fundamental component of the educational methodology at Bondar Academy, especially in technical education where learning a new programming language or framework is involved. The key to mastering these skills lies in writing code; the more you write, the better you become. However, merely replicating code seen in lectures leads to minimal learning. Often, this approach leaves students unclear about why their code works the way it does, as they focus on copying rather than understanding.\n\nA homework assignment at Bondar Academy starts with a blank page, challenging students to apply all their knowledge to write the first line of code. This process is more demanding than it appears. As you write each line, understanding and reasoning grow, making your code meaningful and comprehensible. You learn to write code that makes sense to you, enhancing your understanding.\n\nIn completing these assignments, you engage the 'thinking' part of your brain, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Recognizing the crucial role of homework in learning, our instructors at Bondar Academy are always available to assist with any challenges. Just reach out on Slack, and you'll receive the guidance and support needed for successful completion. At Bondar Academy, we fully understand the importance of homework assignments for the best outcome, so our instructors are always here to assist if you have any difficulties with completing them.
